# SudokuSolver
## WebApp that solves sudokus

### Status:
  -> ~~First wave of the solution generator complete~~<br>
  -> ~~Second wave of the solution generator complete~~<br>
  -> ~~Working on the third wave (genetic algorithm) running on a go server~~

  Project complete for now! May be some fixes in the future, and possibly work on the "bonus" part

### Next:
  -> Add a testing component, comparing scraping results to another sudoku solver?<br>
  -> Add a feature to input base sudoku with a picture (image processing and neural networks)

To do...
Add comments / restructure code
Fix empty board (really empty board)

After all that...
Do some changes on the UI/UX ?

Bonus (neural network)...
Upgrade the tool so it starts from a picture of an unsolved sudoku and maps the values using a neural network
Here's how it'd go
  --> User takes a picture or choose an existing image
  --> User uploads image, which is sent to the server
  --> Server receives the image, decrypts it and returns its guess of the grid to the user
  --> User can validate the guess of the server, or easily correct errors
  --> Once that's done, we're back to the initial problem of solving the sudoku, which should be done at this point
